## 📖 야곰 앱만들기 강의

- UIKit → 사용자에게 보여줄것, 인터렉션할 모든것들
- Event Driven Programming (이벤트 기반 프로그래밍)
    - 이벤트가 발생했을때 특정 코드를 실행하겠다~
- 함수 또는 변수의 이름을 수정할 때, 선언부로 가서 리팩터링 → 중요

## 📖 글꼴 / 이미지 관련

글꼴 

- 색상 → tint

이미지

- Preferred Symbol Configuration
    - Configuration → Font
    - Font → 지정 (Title 3)
    - Scale → 지정 (Large)
    - Weight → 지정 (Bold)
    

## 📖 Auto-Layout

Definition → A layout engine that helps lay out user interface based on the constraints you specify.

so When to use?

- without auto-layout, contents of the screen do not guarantee to match with your expectation. that’s why we need auto-layout.
- once you set constraints of your contents, their locations not only will be stayed or relocated as expected but also will not interfere with others.

## 📖 Differences btw two options

the top two options are for 2 or more contents. if you dragged a couple of items (in this case, info, label, reset), it automatically provides those two options. to be specific, “horizontal Centers” refer to the itmes on both sides will be horizontally centered by center content. for “Vertical Centers” is the other way around.

for the first option of the bottom two, represents that the content will be centered on the screen ( by its screen too!). the second one is the other way around!
